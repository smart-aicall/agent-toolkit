# HalfAI Agent Toolkit — AI Digital Employees for Your Agent

## What is HalfAI?

HalfAI is an **AI Digital Employee platform** built by [OnvoCall](https://onvocall.com) (事半科技). Each digital employee is powered by large language models, capable of real-time emotion sensing, active listening, millisecond-level response, and human-like conversation. They can be a sales manager, a customer service rep, a medical assistant, or a marketing specialist — working 24/7 without breaks.

Outbound calling is just one of their skills. These digital employees hold real phone conversations: greeting, pitching, handling objections, sensing tone shifts, adapting on the fly, and classifying intent. All at enterprise scale.

**HalfAI Agent Toolkit** connects your AI agent (Claude, GPT, or any MCP-compatible agent) to the HalfAI platform. Your agent can deploy digital employees, push leads, monitor call results, adjust conversation scripts in real-time, and receive instant callbacks. All through natural language.

No dashboard clicking. No CSV uploads. Tell your agent what you want. It happens.

## Why HalfAI?

Traditional outbound is manual, slow, and robotic. HalfAI digital employees are different:

- **They actually think** — Connected to mainstream LLMs with context memory, complex reasoning, emotion sensing, and active listening. Not robocalls. Real conversations that feel human.
- **Interrupt anytime** — Users can cut in mid-sentence. The digital employee adapts instantly, just like talking to a real person.
- **Enterprise scale** — Run hundreds of concurrent calls across multiple campaigns, with multiple digital employees working in parallel.
- **Real-time intent analysis** — Every call is analyzed: HIGH interest, HESITATE, or LOW. Results return in seconds.
- **Seamless human handoff** — When a conversation needs a real person, the digital employee transfers smoothly, no awkward transitions.
- **Agent-native** — Built for the AI agent era. Your agent controls the entire lifecycle.

## What Can a Digital Employee Do?

Your AI agent manages a team of specialized digital employees through HalfAI:

- **Sales Manager** — Push a prospect list, let the digital employee cold-call and pitch your product. It handles objections, gauges interest, and your agent gets back a ranked list of hot leads. Script not converting? Your agent rewrites it on the fly.

- **Customer Service Rep** — 7x24 availability. Answers product questions, walks through features, sends documentation links, and escalates to human agents when needed. Logs every interaction.

- **Renewal Specialist** — Reaches out before subscriptions expire. Offers incentives, collects feedback on why someone might churn, and flags at-risk accounts. Your agent monitors retention rates in real-time.

- **Lead Qualifier** — New signups, form submissions, inbound inquiries — all pushed to a digital employee that calls to qualify. Your agent reads back who's ready to buy and who needs nurturing.

- **Appointment Setter** — Patient lists, member lists, client lists. The digital employee calls to schedule, confirm, or reschedule. Your agent tracks confirmation rates.

- **Survey Researcher** — Phone surveys at scale. Define the questions in the conversation script, push a target list, and your agent aggregates structured results.

- **Payment Reminder** — Gentle, natural reminders for overdue invoices, subscription renewals, or membership fees. Your agent tracks who paid and queues second-round calls for the rest.

- **Event Host** — Invite hundreds of contacts to your event by phone. Higher response rates than email. Your agent knows exactly who confirmed.

- **Reactivation Specialist** — Win back dormant users. Push churned customer lists, let the digital employee re-engage them with personalized offers, and see who's ready to come back.

## Not Just Calls — A Full Action Pipeline

A digital employee doesn't just talk. It acts. During and after every call, it can trigger a chain of automated actions based on what happens in the conversation:

### During the Call

| Action | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transfer to human** | Detects the customer needs a real person, transfers the call to a human agent via SIP — seamless, no hang-up |
| **Send SMS** | Sends a text message during the call (verification code, product link, appointment confirmation) via Alibaba Cloud, Lianlu, ColorCube, or Shanhai |
| **Call API** | Hits your backend API mid-conversation — check inventory, look up an order, create a CRM record, anything you configure |
| **Call Webhook** | Fires a webhook to any URL with call context — trigger a Zapier flow, update a spreadsheet, notify a Slack channel |

### After the Call — Intent-Driven Actions

When the call ends, HalfAI analyzes the conversation, extracts structured data, classifies intent, and triggers actions based on the result:

```
Call ends → AI analyzes intent → Routes to action
                ├── HIGH intent  → Push to WeChat group + add as WeChat friend
                ├── HESITATE     → Push to Feishu with @mention for follow-up
                ├── Ticket created → Push work order to DingTalk
                └── Any result   → POST full call record to your server API
```

| Action | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| **Push to WeChat** | Send intent cards to WeChat Work groups — shows intent level, call duration, extracted fields, recording link. Auto @mentions the assigned salesperson. |
| **Push to Feishu** | Rich cards in Feishu groups — uses Feishu App API for @mentions by phone number, includes all extracted customer data |
| **Push to DingTalk** | Markdown messages to DingTalk groups — HMAC-SHA256 signed, with @mention support |
| **Push to your server** | POST structured call results (phone, intent, duration, extracted fields, recording URL) to any API endpoint. Supports Bearer/Basic/API Key auth, HMAC signing, IP whitelist. Up to 3 automatic retries. |
| **Add WeChat friend** | Auto-send friend request via WeChat Work after a high-intent call |
| **Create work ticket** | Generate a follow-up ticket with customer info, push it to Feishu/WeChat/DingTalk groups |

All push actions include retry with exponential backoff (2s → 4s → 8s, up to 3 attempts). Failed pushes are tracked and retried by a background scheduler every minute.

### The Complete Flow

```
1. Connect          2. Deploy               3. Call + Act         4. Results
┌──────────┐       ┌──────────┐          ┌─────────────┐       ┌──────────┐
│ Configure │──────>│ Your AI  │─────────>│ Digital     │──────>│ Intent   │
│ API Key   │       │ deploys  │          │ employee    │       │ analysis │
│           │       │ a digital│   ☎️     │ calls, and  │       │ + push   │
│           │       │ employee │──>📞──>  │ during call:│       │ to:      │
│           │       │          │          │ · SMS       │       │ · WeChat │
└──────────┘       └──────────┘          │ · Transfer  │       │ · Feishu │
                                          │ · API call  │       │ · DingTalk│
                                          │ · Webhook   │       │ · Your API│
                                          └─────────────┘       └──────────┘
```

1. **Your agent pushes a lead** — a phone number plus optional context (name, company, reason for calling)
2. **The digital employee calls automatically** — natural conversation with emotion sensing and active listening
3. **Mid-call actions fire** — sends SMS, transfers to human, calls your API, whatever the script dictates
4. **Post-call pipeline triggers** — AI extracts intent, pushes results to WeChat/Feishu/DingTalk/your server, creates tickets, adds friends

That's it. Your agent has a team of digital employees that don't just talk — they close.
